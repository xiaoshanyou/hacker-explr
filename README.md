#Exploring Hacker News Posts
Hacker News is a site where users can submit posts are voted and commented upon. Hacker News is very popular in technology and startup cicles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.
There are two types of posts that are important for this project: "Ask HN" and "Show HN". People submit "Ask HN" posts to ask Hacker News community a specific question. Likewise, users submit "Shoe HN" posts to show a project, product or something interesting.
<br /> The purpose of this project is to compare these two types of posts and answer the following questions:
<br /> 1. Do "Ask HN" or "Show HN" receive more comments on average?
<br /> 2. Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?

<br /> #Conclusion
<br /> Based on our analysis, ask posts receive more comments than show posts on average. Ask posts that created between 15:00 -16:00 receive largest number of comments.
